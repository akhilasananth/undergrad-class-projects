# UDP-file-transfer-
A very basic 3 part system consisting of a client, an intermediate host, and a server. The client sends requests to the intermediate host, which sends them on to the server. The server sends responses to the intermediate host, which sends them on to the client. From the client's point of view, the intermediate host appears to be the server. From the server's point of view, the intermediate host appears to be the client. In this assignment, the intermediate host will not change the packets, it will just send them on. The intermediate host could be updated to change packets and thus become an error simulator for the system.
